## A simple, yet customisable, counter app for iOS.

I needed to keep track of various things, like work hours, points, etc. Notes.app was starting to become cumbersome for this task, so here's the app.

Counters can be created and deleted (duh), but also personalized with these features:

- Custom steps: when you need to add more than just one;
- Custom unit: what am I counting again?
- Custom completion goal: a nice little bar shows your progress through a value you specify.
